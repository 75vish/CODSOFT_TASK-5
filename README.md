# CODSOFT_TASK-5
Hello everyone,



This is the fifth and the last task of the Codsoft internship in the Data Science field which is based on the credit card fradulent detection. The csv file was too large to fit into the repository but the link to the csv file is right below. You can find the dataset used from the link. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud



The dataset has 31 columns which are as follows- Time ,V1, V2, V3,.........., V28, Amount and Class.



The model uses  Logistic Regression algorithm as well as data science steps such as analysis, preproccessing, visualization, modeling and evaluation along with the techinique of underssampling to balance the highly imbalanced dataset.



Results- Accuracy Score: 0.9105691056910569

     precision    recall  f1-score   support

    0       0.94      0.89      0.91       131

    1       0.88      0.94      0.91       115



Conclusion- The project provides insight on the credit card fradulents taking place and predicts the chances of having a fraud with one by using the datset and the information provided in it.
